2021.11.11
    * Fixed og attributes for article.
    * Upgraded to Mojo::SQLite 3.007, Cpanel::JSON::XS 4.27,
      Minion::Backend::SQLite 5.05, Mojolicious::Plugin::PODViewer 0.007,
      Mojolicious::Plugin::Authentication 1.37, Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI 5.00,
      Mojolicious::Plugin::RoutesConfig 0.07, Net::SMTP 3.13 Role::Tiny 2.002004,
      Mojolicious 9.23.
    * Replaced login form with a new one. Switching to theme Malka.
    * Added new layout for control panel layouts/uprava.html.ep.
    * Slightly improved documentation of Slovo::Themes::Malka.

2021.06.16
    * Fixed failing tests with Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI 4.04.
    * Upgraded to Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI 4.04.

2021.06.06
    * Updated progress in the documentation.
    * Allow commands from the Mojolicious::Command::Author::generate namespace
      to be listed and executed by Slovo on the command-line. Added tests.
    * Added README.pod to the distribution.
    * Fixed missing hidden field for permissions when creating a page.

2021.05.21
    * Fix canonical URL when it can contain a double slash.

2021.05.15
    * Added initial OpenGraph support.
    * Optimised _around_execute in Slovo::Controller::Role::Stranica to do as
      little as possible when serving cached content.

2021.02.20
    * Renamed configuration section `plugins` to `load_plugins` so it does not
      clash with the same feature in Mojolicious 9.0. Kept the feature as Slovo's
      one is more flexible. Slovo is compatible with Mojolicious 9.0.
    * Added `mojo` subfolder to the mod_rewrite rule for public/ in the
      .htaccess file template so we can put static files like jquery/jquery.js
      there and they will be served directly by Apache.
    * Made scrollbar-width wider in Slovo::Themes::Malka.
    * Upgraded to Mojolicious 9.02.

2021.02.01
    * We now require minimum version of Perl 5.26 to remove from our code
      `no warnings "experimental::lexical_subs";`. Respectively we explicitly
      require at least ExtUtils::MakeMaker 7.24.
    * Since Perl 5.26 "the lexical_subs feature has no effect; all Perl code
      can use lexical (private) subroutines, regardless of what feature
      declarations are in scope." So we replaced `use feature qw(lexical_subs
      unicode_strings);` with `use feature ':5.26';`. We just use the whole
      feature bundle now.
    * Changed behavior of Slovo::Command::Author::inflate and improved its
      documentation. The different types of files are now prefixed with
      `templates/` and `public/` only if they are inflated into the
      $app->home directory.
    * Improved lib/Slovo.pm's POD.
    * Database migration is not automatic any more. From now on one must run
      `bin/slovo eval 'app->dbx->migrations->migrate'`.
    * Added new `BEFORE UPDATE` SQL triggers that check if pid!=id and if the
      parent record is a directory, and throw an SQL statement error.
    * Added meta tags for 'author', 'description' and 'keywords' in
      partials/_head.html.ep with default content from the respective row in
      table celini.

2021.01.11
    * Happy new year!
    * Fixed a bug in Slovo::Controller::Role::Stranica::page_id_options(...)
      which caused unpleasant recursion in site menu when the root page is
      edited and saved. Root page was being set with pid=id, but it should
      always have pid=0.
    * Moved templates from themes/malka to lib/Slovo/Themes/Malka.pm.
    * Deleted existing default templates for the "site" part of the templates.
      Now Slovo::Themes::Malka is the default theme for the site.
    * Implemented Slovo::Command::Author::inflate.


2020.12.22
    * Added new lightweight theme, named "malka". Using
      https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css and
      https://github.com/jenil/chota.
      Work in progress!!
    * MUI CSS is deprecated and may be removed soon.
      The new theme will be the default.
    * Now lib/Slovo/resources/templates comes after $app->home/templates in
      @{$app->static->paths} and lib/Slovo/resources/public comes after
      $app->home/public in @{$app->renderer->paths}.
    * Added new column 'templates' to table 'domove'. This way every domain can
      switch easily the theme without moving files around - just by pointing to
      the theme directory where the templates reside.
    * Implemented Slovo::Cache to support mutiple domains theming by storing
      compiled templates with different key prefix per domain.
    * Moved .perlcriticrc to the root directory of the project.
    * In the control panel the pages now are sorted only by 'sorting'.
    * Mojo deprecated the default behavior of writing to log/$mode.log and we
      implemented by default writing to log/$moniker.log if possible.
    * Refactored and improved Slovo::Controller::Role::Stranica and the
      corresponding Controller and Model classes, tests and templates.
    * Many bugs were fixed along the way.


2020.12.12
    * Improved messages and documentation of commands a2htaccess and novy_dom.
    * Now default permissions for folders created by novy_dom are 0755. This
      allows Apache to read static files.
    * Page-form now shows site_name for hidden field 'dom_id' - better for
      sites with unicode names.
    * We do not use any more environment variable REWRITE_ENGINE_ON from
      .htaccess to tell slovo.cgi to remove SCRIPT_NAME from URL. This is done
      via config option for Slovo plugin CGI 'mod_rewrite', which defaults to
      1 meaning enabled.
    * Improved /celini/create functionality - better handling of missing
      parameters.
    * Deprecated route /manage/celini in favour of /manage/stranici/:page_id/celini.

2020.12.01
    * Fixed bug - 'page_type', 'box' and 'data_type' columns' values in
      database were not changed while translating identifiers. Now this is
      done. See migrations.sql
    * Translated the above mentioned remaining values from Bulgarian(Cyrillic)
      to English(Latin).
    * Added parameters descriptions for 'box'and 'page_type' in api-v1.0.json.
    * Added possible value for data_type - 'chapter' in api-v1.0.json.
    * Added 'boxes','data_formats' and 'page_types' to $app->defaults and used
      them accross the application as "single source of truth".
    * Slightly improved documentation.
    * We do not allow any more pages to be moved across domains.
    * We do not allow any more a page with page_type 'root' to be created.
      Every domain has only one such page and it is created with command 'slovo
      generate novy-dom'.
    * We do not list page titles with the rest of celini records. They can be
      edited as part of a page.
    * Now using Veleka2 font.

2020.11.22
    * Fixed a bug - The adaptor class (Mojo::SQLite/mysql/Pg) reinstantiated
      each time $app->dbx was invoked. Now this is done only on the first
      invocation.
    * Removed deprecation warning about MojoDBx 'helper' setting. Now the
      helper is always "dbx".
    * Default configuration from slovo.conf was moved to MojoDBx. If you use
      slovo.$mode.conf your instance should not be affected as your file
      will be preferred.
    * Now more properties(columns) of the $stranici object are fetched from the
      database. See '/paths/~1stranici/get/parameters/4/default' in
      lib/Slovo/resources/api-v1.0.json
    * Implemented new hook "around_action", where we set some common
      variables, used in templates ($l - current language and $user - current user).
    * Fixed bugs:
      - page_id was not properly set in the $celina object, which is used for
      title of the page.
      - Stash variables for use in templates were not properly set when there
      was a validation error.
      - Moving a $celina to another page is disabled (until we  implement proper
      select field).
      - Some fields required validation filter "not_empty" - otherwise they were
      validated as "required".
    * Setting stash defaults now happens only in lib/Slovo.pm
    * Now fieldsets are collapsed only if there are no validation errors.
    * Moved fieldset "Съдържанѥ на страницата" to the top of the page form.

2020.11.11
    Get back to Slovo after getting my master degree in programme "Medieval
    Bulgarian Studies" – Sofia University "St. Kliment Ochridski".
    * Switched to codename U+2C14 GLAGOLITIC CAPITAL LETTER SLOVO (Ⱄ). With
      this we mark the renewal of the project.
    * Changed double quotes to single quotes for values
      in lib/Slovo/resources/data/migrations.sql as "suddenly" they started to
      be treated as columns. This happens as of DBD::SQLite 1.63_05 2019-07-12.
      Fixed #28.
    * Minor fixes in lib/Slovo/resources/api-v1.0.json. "maxLength" value needs
      to be an integer.
    * Changed all identifiers for data types in table celini from
      Bulgarian(Cyrillic) to English(Latin) to increase understanding by
      potential nonslavic contributors. Here they are: въпросъ => question;
      книга => book; писанѥ => writing; белѣжка => note; заглавѥ => title.
    * Upgraded to Mojolicious 8.65, Mojo::SQLite 3.004, Cpanel::JSON::XS 4.25
      Minion::Backend::SQLite 5.0.3, Role::Tiny 2.001004, EV 4.33,
      Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI 3.40, Mojolicious::Plugin::RoutesConfig 0.06
      Test::PerlTidy 20200930, Perl::Critic 1.38.
    * Changed most css and route identifiers from Bulgarian(Cyrillic) to
      English(Latin) too. Fixed #16.
    * Preferring data/slovo.$mode.sqlite if found upon startup over
      lib/Slovo/resourcesdata/slovo.$mode.sqlite.

      update domain specific templates after upgrading Slovo.
    * Improved command a2htaccess and Slovo::Plugin::CGI by adding environment

          time. An email with first-time login token is sent to the new user
          via SMTP. See Slovo::Task::SendOnboardingEmail.

          not work. TODO: fix.

    - Changes
        * Slovo now depends on Minion and Minion::Backend::SQLite which will be
          used for asynchronous execution of various time consuming tasks.
        * The configuration parameters for a plugin loaded via slovo.conf can
          be returned via a closure which is executed just before the plugin is
          loaded. Very convenient for using already generated routes and other
          already available functionality by plugins which are loaded later.
        * Added .travis.yml. Now every push will be built on
          https://travis-ci.org/kberov/Slovo

          caching of content on disk and 'cache_control' to allow setting the
         'Cache-Control' header for fine grained browser cache management.
    - Changes
        * Fix: 'tstamp' value was not set during 'stranici' and 'celini' update.

          now by default.
        * Cannonical link in <head> now is not url_escape-d, nor domain name is

2018.08.28
    - Features:
        * Added and setup HTML wysiwyg editor Trumbowyg to the distribution.
          It was chosen because of its small size and easiness to use and

          data in the 'src' attribute of the img tag.
        * Added post-processing of the 'body' property of a stranica and celina
          just before save in case the data_format is 'html'. The base64 data
          in the images is saved as files in the public/img folder of the
          respective domain.  This allows images to be shared among pages and
          decreases the size of 'body'.
        * Added switching of editors on change of the 'data_format' field.
          Simple textarea for 'text' and Trumbowyg for 'html'. In the future
          other editors will/may be added for 'pod', 'markdown' and asciitext.

          a guest user sees the cached page. Page load is 15 times faster.
        * Full multi-domain support. Domains can have their own public and
          template folders and be served from one running Slovo instance.

          checks before the page is rendered and leave room for executing code
          after the page is rendered.
    - Changes
        * Now the IDN is always shown decoded in the sidedrawer.

        * Improved action execute and its template in
          Slovo::Contoller::Stranici. Added partial templates for almost all

          served. For example 'http://127.0.0.1/alias.стр.html' finds the page
          'alias' in domain localhost.
        * When a page cannot be found a "Not Found" page is displayed.
        * When a page is displayed the `permissions` and `published` matter.

2018.12.08
    - Changes
        * Now Slovo looks for configuration file in the following order:
          1. $ENV{MOJO_CONFIG};
          2. $app->home->child("$moniker.$mode.conf")
          3. $app->home->child("$moniker.conf")
          4. $app->resources->child("etc/$moniker.$mode.conf").
          Default: $app->resources->child("etc/$moniker.conf")
        * Improved Slovo.pm POD.
        * Improved the generated token for first login.

2018.11.30

          account for other users and invite them to sign in for the first
          time. An email with first-time login token is sent to the new user
          via SMTP. See Slovo::Task::SendOnboardingEmail.
        * We have Bootstrap CSS 4 for free. Comming together with Minion.
        * Minion admin UI (Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion::Admin) is available for
          members of the admin group at /Ꙋправленѥ/minion. Note: Links in UI do
          not work. TODO: fix.

    - Changes
        * Slovo now depends on Minion and Minion::Backend::SQLite which will be
          used for asynchronous execution of various time consuming tasks.
        * The configuration parameters for a plugin loaded via slovo.conf can
          be returned via a closure which is executed just before the plugin is
          loaded. Very convenient for using already generated routes and other
          already available functionality by plugins which are loaded later.
        * Added .travis.yml. Now every push will be built on
          https://travis-ci.org/kberov/Slovo
        * Added Several other dependencies both for authors and for production.
          See Makefile.PL.

          caching of content on disk and 'cache_control' to allow setting the

2018.08.28
    - Features:
        * Added and setup HTML wysiwyg editor Trumbowyg to the distribution.
          It was chosen because of its small size and easiness to use and

          data in the 'src' attribute of the img tag.
        * Added post-processing of the 'body' property of a stranica and celina
          just before save in case the data_format is 'html'. The base64 data
          in the images is saved as files in the public/img folder of the
          respective domain.  This allows images to be shared among pages and
          decreases the size of 'body'.
        * Added switching of editors on change of the 'data_format' field.
          Simple textarea for 'text' and Trumbowyg for 'html'. In the future
          other editors will/may be added for 'pod', 'markdown' and asciitext.

          properties are used for bot filling in the select_box(es) and for
          'in' checks during validation.

2018.08.19
    - Features
        * Implemented page caching on disk. Page is cached if published and
          readable by 'others', and visited by a guest user. On the next visit
          a guest user sees the cached page. Page load is 15 times faster.
        * Full multi-domain support. Domains can have their own public and
          template folders and be served from one running Slovo instance.

    - Changes
        * Startup script 'slovo' was improved. Slovo can be installed and ran
          with all dependencies in it's on local folder. Previously it did not

          cacheable pages.

2018.08.12
    - Features
        * Added nice multi-language routes (/<страница:str>.<ѩꙁыкъ:lng>.html,
          /<страница:str>/<цѣлина:cel>.<ѩꙁыкъ:lng>.html).

        * Added a set of languages to the forms for celini and stranici.

          page title - заглавѥ.

        * The $c->debug method is now a helper and can be used in templates
         without $c.
        * Fixed and optimised mapping of data_type to template name for
          displaying a record from celini.
        * Changed CODENAME to U+2C0E GLAGOLITIC CAPITAL LETTER LJUDIJE (Ⰾ).

          generic one for custom data types.
        * Slovo::Plugin::DefaultHelpers – additional default helpers for Slovo.
        * Implemented Slovo::Controller::Role::Stranica with wrapper around
          execute() to share some common stash settings, preparations and
          checks before the page is rendered and leave room for executing code
          after the page is rendered.
    - Changes
        * Now the IDN is always shown decoded in the sidedrawer.
        * Moved helpers 'language' and 'is_user_authenticated' from Slovo to
          Slovo::Plugin::DefaultHelpers.
        * DefaultHelpers and TagHelpers are loaded unconditionally after all
          other mandatory for Slovo plugins.
        * Improved action execute and its template in
          Slovo::Contoller::Stranici. Added partial templates for almost all
          celini data_types. Moved my $breadcrumb fom controler to
          Slovo::Model::Stranici where it belongs.

        * User Guest is always loaded to have some default permissions for
          every not logged in user.
        * Replaced helper "is_user_authenticated" from
          Mojolicious::Plugin::Authentication. Now it checks if the current
          user is not Guest and returns true, false otherwise.

          applcation. Domains can be matched also by IPs from which they are
          served. For example 'http://127.0.0.1/alias.стр.html' finds the page
          'alias' in domain localhost.

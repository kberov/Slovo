          3. $app->home->child("$moniker.conf")
          4. $app->resources->child("etc/$moniker.$mode.conf").

          via SMTP. See Slovo::Task::SendOnboardingEmail.

          not work. TODO: fix.

    - Changes
        * Slovo now depends on Minion and Minion::Backend::SQLite which will be
          used for asynchronous execution of various time consuming tasks.
        * The configuration parameters for a plugin loaded via slovo.conf can
          be returned via a closure which is executed just before the plugin is
          loaded. Very convenient for using already generated routes and other
          already available functionality by plugins which are loaded later.
        * Added .travis.yml. Now every push will be built on
          https://travis-ci.org/kberov/Slovo

          caching of content on disk and 'cache_control' to allow setting the

2018.08.28
    - Features:
        * Added and setup HTML wysiwyg editor Trumbowyg to the distribution.
          It was chosen because of its small size and easiness to use and

          just before save in case the data_format is 'html'. The base64 data
          in the images is saved as files in the public/img folder of the
          respective domain.  This allows images to be shared among pages and
          decreases the size of 'body'.

        * Implemented page caching on disk. Page is cached if published and
          readable by 'others', and visited by a guest user. On the next visit
          a guest user sees the cached page. Page load is 15 times faster.
        * Full multi-domain support. Domains can have their own public and
          template folders and be served from one running Slovo instance.

    - Changes
        * Startup script 'slovo' was improved. Slovo can be installed and ran

          page title - заглавѥ.

         without $c.

          after the page is rendered.
    - Changes
        * Now the IDN is always shown decoded in the sidedrawer.
        * Moved helpers 'language' and 'is_user_authenticated' from Slovo to

          other mandatory for Slovo plugins.
        * Improved action execute and its template in
          Slovo::Contoller::Stranici. Added partial templates for almost all

    - Changes
        * On failed login the guest user is loaded to have always a user.

          up to this version.

    - Features
        * Added attribute `domain` to Slovo::Controller.
        * Now UTF-8 characters are readable in dumped structures by $c->debug.
        * Added multidomain support. Many domains can be served by one Slovo
          applcation. Domains can be matched also by IPs from which they are
          served. For example 'http://127.0.0.1/alias.стр.html' finds the page
          'alias' in domain localhost.
        * When a page cannot be found a "Not Found" page is displayed.
        * When a page is displayed the `permissions` and `published` matter.
          Secondary groups of a user are supported. In preview mode
          (?прегледъ=1) published, hidden, deleted, start and stop are
          disregarded.

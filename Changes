Revision history for Mojolicious application Slovo

2021.06.06
    * Updated progress in the documentation.
    * Allow commands from the Mojolicious::Command::Author::generate namespace
      to be listed and executed by Slovo on the command-line. Added tests.
    * Added README.pod to the distribution.
    * Fixed missing hidden field for permissions when creating a page.

2021.05.21
    * Fix canonical URL when it can contain a double slash.

2021.05.15
    * Added initial OpenGraph support.
    * Optimised _around_execute in Slovo::Controller::Role::Stranica to do as
      little as possible when serving cached content.

2021.02.20
    * Renamed configuration section `plugins` to `load_plugins` so it does not
      clash with the same feature in Mojolicious 9.0. Kept the feature as Slovo's
      one is more flexible. Slovo is compatible with Mojolicious 9.0.
    * Added `mojo` subfolder to the mod_rewrite rule for public/ in the
      .htaccess file template so we can put static files like jquery/jquery.js
      there and they will be served directly by Apache.
    * Made scrollbar-width wider in Slovo::Themes::Malka.
    * Upgraded to Mojolicious 9.02.

2021.02.01
    * We now require minimum version of Perl 5.26 to remove from our code
      `no warnings "experimental::lexical_subs";`. Respectively we explicitly
      require at least ExtUtils::MakeMaker 7.24.
    * Since Perl 5.26 "the lexical_subs feature has no effect; all Perl code
      can use lexical (private) subroutines, regardless of what feature
      declarations are in scope." So we replaced `use feature qw(lexical_subs
      unicode_strings);` with `use feature ':5.26';`. We just use the whole
      feature bundle now.
    * Changed behavior of Slovo::Command::Author::inflate and improved its
      documentation. The different types of files are now prefixed with
      `templates/` and `public/` only if they are inflated into the
      $app->home directory.
    * Improved lib/Slovo.pm's POD.
    * Database migration is not automatic any more. From now on one must run
      `bin/slovo eval 'app->dbx->migrations->migrate'`.
    * Added new `BEFORE UPDATE` SQL triggers that check if pid!=id and if the
      parent record is a directory, and throw an SQL statement error.
    * Added meta tags for 'author', 'description' and 'keywords' in
      partials/_head.html.ep with default content from the respective row in
      table celini.

2021.01.11
    * Happy new year!
    * Fixed a bug in Slovo::Controller::Role::Stranica::page_id_options(...)
      which caused unpleasant recursion in site menu when the root page is
      edited and saved. Root page was being set with pid=id, but it should
      always have pid=0.
    * Moved templates from themes/malka to lib/Slovo/Themes/Malka.pm.
    * Deleted existing default templates for the "site" part of the templates.
      Now Slovo::Themes::Malka is the default theme for the site.
    * Implemented Slovo::Command::Author::inflate.


2020.12.22
    * Added new lightweight theme, named "malka". Using
      https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css and
      https://github.com/jenil/chota.
      Work in progress!!
    * MUI CSS is deprecated and may be removed soon.
      The new theme will be the default.
    * Now lib/Slovo/resources/templates comes after $app->home/templates in
      @{$app->static->paths} and lib/Slovo/resources/public comes after
      $app->home/public in @{$app->renderer->paths}.
    * Added new column 'templates' to table 'domove'. This way every domain can
      switch easily the theme without moving files around - just by pointing to
      the theme directory where the templates reside.
    * Implemented Slovo::Cache to support mutiple domains theming by storing
      compiled templates with different key prefix per domain.
    * Moved .perlcriticrc to the root directory of the project.
    * In the control panel the pages now are sorted only by 'sorting'.
    * Mojo deprecated the default behavior of writing to log/$mode.log and we
      implemented by default writing to log/$moniker.log if possible.
    * Refactored and improved Slovo::Controller::Role::Stranica and the
      corresponding Controller and Model classes, tests and templates.
    * Many bugs were fixed along the way.


2020.12.12
    * Improved messages and documentation of commands a2htaccess and novy_dom.
    * Now default permissions for folders created by novy_dom are 0755. This
      allows Apache to read static files.
    * Page-form now shows site_name for hidden field 'dom_id' - better for
      sites with unicode names.
    * We do not use any more environment variable REWRITE_ENGINE_ON from
      .htaccess to tell slovo.cgi to remove SCRIPT_NAME from URL. This is done
      via config option for Slovo plugin CGI 'mod_rewrite', which defaults to
      1 meaning enabled.
    * Improved /celini/create functionality - better handling of missing
      parameters.
    * Deprecated route /manage/celini in favour of /manage/stranici/:page_id/celini.

2020.12.01
    * Fixed bug - 'page_type', 'box' and 'data_type' columns' values in
      database were not changed while translating identifiers. Now this is
      done. See migrations.sql
    * Translated the above mentioned remaining values from Bulgarian(Cyrillic)
      to English(Latin).
    * Added parameters descriptions for 'box'and 'page_type' in api-v1.0.json.
    * Added possible value for data_type - 'chapter' in api-v1.0.json.
    * Added 'boxes','data_formats' and 'page_types' to $app->defaults and used
      them accross the application as "single source of truth".
    * Slightly improved documentation.
    * We do not allow any more pages to be moved across domains.
    * We do not allow any more a page with page_type 'root' to be created.
      Every domain has only one such page and it is created with command 'slovo
      generate novy-dom'.
    * We do not list page titles with the rest of celini records. They can be
      edited as part of a page.
    * Now using Veleka2 font.

2020.11.22
    * Fixed a bug - The adaptor class (Mojo::SQLite/mysql/Pg) reinstantiated
      each time $app->dbx was invoked. Now this is done only on the first
      invocation.
    * Removed deprecation warning about MojoDBx 'helper' setting. Now the
      helper is always "dbx".
    * Default configuration from slovo.conf was moved to MojoDBx. If you use
      slovo.$mode.conf your instance should not be affected as your file
      will be preferred.
    * Now more properties(columns) of the $stranici object are fetched from the
      database. See '/paths/~1stranici/get/parameters/4/default' in
      lib/Slovo/resources/api-v1.0.json
    * Implemented new hook "around_action", where we set some common
      variables, used in templates ($l - current language and $user - current user).
    * Fixed bugs:
      - page_id was not properly set in the $celina object, which is used for
      title of the page.
      - Stash variables for use in templates were not properly set when there
      was a validation error.
      - Moving a $celina to another page is disabled (until we  implement proper
      select field).
      - Some fields required validation filter "not_empty" - otherwise they were
      validated as "required".
    * Setting stash defaults now happens only in lib/Slovo.pm
    * Now fieldsets are collapsed only if there are no validation errors.
    * Moved fieldset "Съдържанѥ на страницата" to the top of the page form.

2020.11.11
    Get back to Slovo after getting my master degree in programme "Medieval
    Bulgarian Studies" – Sofia University "St. Kliment Ochridski".
    * Switched to codename U+2C14 GLAGOLITIC CAPITAL LETTER SLOVO (Ⱄ). With
      this we mark the renewal of the project.
    * Changed double quotes to single quotes for values
      in lib/Slovo/resources/data/migrations.sql as "suddenly" they started to
      be treated as columns. This happens as of DBD::SQLite 1.63_05 2019-07-12.
      Fixed #28.
    * Minor fixes in lib/Slovo/resources/api-v1.0.json. "maxLength" value needs
      to be an integer.
    * Changed all identifiers for data types in table celini from
      Bulgarian(Cyrillic) to English(Latin) to increase understanding by
      potential nonslavic contributors. Here they are: въпросъ => question;
      книга => book; писанѥ => writing; белѣжка => note; заглавѥ => title.
    * Upgraded to Mojolicious 8.65, Mojo::SQLite 3.004, Cpanel::JSON::XS 4.25
      Minion::Backend::SQLite 5.0.3, Role::Tiny 2.001004, EV 4.33,
      Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI 3.40, Mojolicious::Plugin::RoutesConfig 0.06
      Test::PerlTidy 20200930, Perl::Critic 1.38.
    * Changed most css and route identifiers from Bulgarian(Cyrillic) to
      English(Latin) too. Fixed #16.
    * Preferring data/slovo.$mode.sqlite if found upon startup over
      lib/Slovo/resourcesdata/slovo.$mode.sqlite.

2019.07.11
    * Added new options --skip and --refresh to command novy_dom to easily
      update domain specific templates after upgrading Slovo.
    * Improved command a2htaccess and Slovo::Plugin::CGI by adding environment
      variable REWRITE_ENGINE_ON so the url_base is changed accordingly to

          time. An email with first-time login token is sent to the new user
          via SMTP. See Slovo::Task::SendOnboardingEmail.
        * We have Bootstrap CSS 4 for free. Comming together with Minion.
        * Minion admin UI (Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion::Admin) is available for
          members of the admin group at /Ꙋправленѥ/minion. Note: Links in UI do
          not work. TODO: fix.

    - Changes
        * Slovo now depends on Minion and Minion::Backend::SQLite which will be
          used for asynchronous execution of various time consuming tasks.
        * The configuration parameters for a plugin loaded via slovo.conf can
          be returned via a closure which is executed just before the plugin is
          loaded. Very convenient for using already generated routes and other
          already available functionality by plugins which are loaded later.
        * Added .travis.yml. Now every push will be built on
          https://travis-ci.org/kberov/Slovo

          caching of content on disk and 'cache_control' to allow setting the
         'Cache-Control' header for fine grained browser cache management.
    - Changes
        * Fix: 'tstamp' value was not set during 'stranici' and 'celini' update.

          It was chosen because of its small size and easiness to use and
          extend.
        * Added extension 'base64' for embedding images into the page as base64
          data in the 'src' attribute of the img tag.
        * Added post-processing of the 'body' property of a stranica and celina
          just before save in case the data_format is 'html'. The base64 data
          in the images is saved as files in the public/img folder of the
          respective domain.  This allows images to be shared among pages and
          decreases the size of 'body'.
        * Added switching of editors on change of the 'data_format' field.
          Simple textarea for 'text' and Trumbowyg for 'html'. In the future
          other editors will/may be added for 'pod', 'markdown' and asciitext.

    - Changes
        * Added documentation to Slovo::Controller::Role::Stranica.
        * 'data_type' and 'data_format' possible values are now added to the
          'parameters' object of api-v1.0.json. From there these enum
          properties are used for bot filling in the select_box(es) and for
          'in' checks during validation.

2018.08.19
    - Features
        * Implemented page caching on disk. Page is cached if published and
          readable by 'others', and visited by a guest user. On the next visit
          a guest user sees the cached page. Page load is 15 times faster.
        * Full multi-domain support. Domains can have their own public and
          template folders and be served from one running Slovo instance.

    - Changes
        * Startup script 'slovo' was improved. Slovo can be installed and ran
          with all dependencies in it's on local folder. Previously it did not

        * Improved documentation. Mention all current features.

          cacheable pages.

2018.08.12
    - Features
        * Added nice multi-language routes (/<страница:str>.<ѩꙁыкъ:lng>.html,
          /<страница:str>/<цѣлина:cel>.<ѩꙁыкъ:lng>.html).
        * Added more restrictive route-placeholders types (cel,str,lng).
        * Added a set of languages to the forms for celini and stranici.

          generic one for custom data types.
        * Slovo::Plugin::DefaultHelpers – additional default helpers for Slovo.
        * Implemented Slovo::Controller::Role::Stranica with wrapper around
          execute() to share some common stash settings, preparations and
          checks before the page is rendered and leave room for executing code
          after the page is rendered.
    - Changes
        * Now the IDN is always shown decoded in the sidedrawer.
        * Moved helpers 'language' and 'is_user_authenticated' from Slovo to
          Slovo::Plugin::DefaultHelpers.
        * DefaultHelpers and TagHelpers are loaded unconditionally after all
          other mandatory for Slovo plugins.
        * Improved action execute and its template in
          Slovo::Contoller::Stranici. Added partial templates for almost all
          celini data_types. Moved my $breadcrumb fom controler to
          Slovo::Model::Stranici where it belongs.

          served. For example 'http://127.0.0.1/alias.стр.html' finds the page
          'alias' in domain localhost.
        * When a page cannot be found a "Not Found" page is displayed.
        * When a page is displayed the `permissions` and `published` matter.
